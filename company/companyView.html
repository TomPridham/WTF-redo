        <p>Wyoming Test Fixtures, Inc. was incorporated in February 1988. The owner and President is Dr. Donald F.
            Adams, who is also Emeritus Professor of Mechanical Engineering and former Director of the Composite
            Materials Research Group at the University of Wyoming. Ms. Catherine O'Hare Adams is the business manager.
            All fixtures are fabricated in a precision machine shop and inspected against the highest possible standards
            by experienced personnel.</p>

        <p>Wyoming Test Fixtures, Inc. is an outgrowth of the fixture design and fabrication activities conducted at the
            University of Wyoming by Dr. Adams and his colleagues for over 30 years, plus Dr. Adams' prior 12 years of
            industry design, analysis, and testing experience, 9 years of which were specifically in composite materials
            applications.</p>

        <p>Dr. Adams has used most of the many available fixtures in his own funded research work at the University of
            Wyoming, and thus is very familiar with their use, and relative performance. In fact, many test fixtures in
            common use today were either developed or significantly modified at the University of Wyoming by Dr. Adams
            and his Group over the years. Others have been developed directly by Wyoming Test Fixtures, Inc. Dr. Adams
            is also active in various standardization groups such as ASTM and CMH-17, and has presented test methods
            seminars and short courses throughout the United States and elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Wyoming Test Fixtures, Inc. shares with its customers the benefits of this active and continuous
            participation in new test method developments, and a strong background in mechanical design. In addition to
            direct consultations, many journal publications and research reports on specific topics are available to its
            customers upon request.</p>

        <p>The goal of Wyoming Test Fixtures, Inc. is to provide its customers test fixtures of the highest possible
            quality, promptly, and at the lowest possible prices.</p>

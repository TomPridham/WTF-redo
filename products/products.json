                  "The Iosipescu shear test fixture was actively developed for use with composite materials during the late 1970s and early 1980s by the Composite Materials Research Group at the University of Wyoming.  A large number of fixtures have been provided to research groups around the world since that time and the test method is now in widespread use. ASTM Standard D 5379 governing the test method was first issued in 1993 (Reference 1). General testing procedures are provided in that standard. In addition, considerable additional discussion of results typically obtained is contained in the references listed here.",
                  "The standard test specimen (as shown installed in the front view photograph of Fig. 1) is 3\" long, 0.75\" wide, and of any thickness up to 0.50\". Typically, a specimen on the order of 0.1\" thick is used. The fixture will also accommodate shorter and narrower specimens, if desired.  A 90° notch is machined into each edge of the specimen, and a strain gage can be mounted on the specimen surface in the notched region to monitor shear strain. Either a standard ±45° biaxial gage or a special Iosipescu gage is commonly used. The small diameter rod projecting out of the fixture below the lower notch in the specimen (front view photograph in Fig. 1) is lifted up with a finger while installing a test specimen, to center the specimen left to right. The specimen is pushed up against the flat back of the fixture to locate it fore and aft. The tapered wedges are not intended to be clamps; they are adjusted with finger knobs to accommodate specimens of slightly varying widths. Wedges of alternate thickness can be provided to accommodate specimens outside this small range of thickness variation.",
                  "The moving half of the fixture incorporates a linear ball bushing (see rear view photograph in Fig. 1) that moves on a hardened steel vertical post mounted in the base of the fixture. This ball bearing eliminates guidepost binding and minimizes frictional resistance. The closeness of fit of the bearing can be adjusted via the screw and locking nut visible on the backside of the moving half of the fixture.",
                  "In use, the fixture rests unconstrained directly on the base of the testing machine. A standard 1.25\" diameter stud with lock ring and 0.50\" diameter cross-pin hole, threaded into the moving half of the fixture, is provided with the fixture, as shown on the standard-size fixture in Fig. 2. Any special adapter required to attach this stud to the particular testing machine being used, such as the standard Instron Type Df adapter shown in Fig. 1, can be provided as an option at nominal additional cost. The adapter is pinned to the stud and secured via the lock ring provided with the fixture."

                  "These gripping surfaces are coated with tungsten carbide particles, as shown in Fig. 2,  to enhance the frictional force and thus permit higher shear load transfer into the specimen.  And since these surfaces are relatively smooth (100 grit particles), they do not damage the surface of the specimen. This permits the use of untabbed specimens in many applications, a major advantage in terms of specimen fabrication cost.",
                  "By adjusting the bolt torque, the ratio of end- to shear-loading of the specimen can be controlled, i.e., combined loading can be achieved. This permits the successful testing of stronger materials than if the specimen was purely end-loaded (by avoiding end crushing), and less clamping force than if the specimen was purely shear-loaded (lower clamping-induced stress concentrations).",
                  "The fixture blocks also prevent gross buckling of the specimen. Two alignment rods in linear bearings are used to keep the upper and lower pairs of blocks aligned, the linear bearings eliminating frictional binding of the alignment rods. The circular recess shown in one face provides clearance for an edge-mounted extensometer, if used. Alternatively, bonded strain gages can be used on one or both faces of the specimen.",
                  "The assembled fixture, with a specimen installed, is placed unconstrained on a flat base of the testing machine, and loaded directly on its top face by a flat platen mounted in the crosshead of the testing machine.",
                  "The Wyoming Combined Loading Compression (CLC) Test Fixture is designed to accommodate tabbed or untabbed specimens 5.5\" long.  This is the same length as commonly used with the IITRI tabbed specimen test method (ASTM D 3410). The gage length (the distance between the restraining end blocks), at 0.50\" is also the same. The CLC fixture can be used to test nonstandard gage length specimens by simply altering the specimen total length.  This fixture is relatively compact, weighing 10.6 lb.",
                  "The CLC test method has been shown to be totally suitable for compression testing untabbed specimens of materials of moderate strengths, e.g., composites exhibiting compressive strengths up to about 150 ksi, which includes cross-ply and quasi-isotropic lay-up laminates, fabric composites, random chopped-fiber composites, and other materials of similar or lower strength.  In such cases the CLC test fixture has been shown to produce compressive strength and modulus values fully equivalent to those obtained using tabbed specimens and more complex and expensive test fixtures such as the IITRI, Wyoming Modified IITRI, Celanese, and Wyoming Modified Celanese configurations (References 1 through 3).",
                  "For higher compressive strength, highly orthotropic materials such as unidirectional carbon- or glass-fiber reinforced polymer-matrix composites, a tabbed specimen can be used, just as with the Modified ASTM D 695 Compression Test Method, a pure end-loading method, or the IITRI Test Method (ASTM D 3410), a pure shear-loading method. However, this does negate the simplification and cost savings associated with the use of an untabbed specimen. A viable option is to use an untabbed, thickness-tapered specimen when testing these highly orthotropic composites (References 5 and 6)."

                  "The Iosipescu shear test fixture was actively developed for use with composite materials during the late 1970s and early 1980s by the Composite Materials Research Group at the University of Wyoming.  A large number of fixtures have been provided to research groups around the world since that time and the test method is now in widespread use. ASTM Standard D 5379 governing the test method was first issued in 1993 (Reference 1). General testing procedures are provided in that standard. In addition, considerable additional discussion of results typically obtained is contained in the references listed here.",
                  "The standard test specimen (as shown installed in the front view photograph of Fig. 1) is 3\" long, 0.75\" wide, and of any thickness up to 0.50\". Typically, a specimen on the order of 0.1\" thick is used. The fixture will also accommodate shorter and narrower specimens, if desired.  A 90° notch is machined into each edge of the specimen, and a strain gage can be mounted on the specimen surface in the notched region to monitor shear strain. Either a standard ±45° biaxial gage or a special Iosipescu gage is commonly used. The small diameter rod projecting out of the fixture below the lower notch in the specimen (front view photograph in Fig. 1) is lifted up with a finger while installing a test specimen, to center the specimen left to right. The specimen is pushed up against the flat back of the fixture to locate it fore and aft. The tapered wedges are not intended to be clamps; they are adjusted with finger knobs to accommodate specimens of slightly varying widths. Wedges of alternate thickness can be provided to accommodate specimens outside this small range of thickness variation.",
                  "The moving half of the fixture incorporates a linear ball bushing (see rear view photograph in Fig. 1) that moves on a hardened steel vertical post mounted in the base of the fixture. This ball bearing eliminates guidepost binding and minimizes frictional resistance. The closeness of fit of the bearing can be adjusted via the screw and locking nut visible on the backside of the moving half of the fixture.",

A standard 1.25\" diameter stud with lock ring and 0.50\" diameter cross-pin hole, threaded into the moving half of the fixture, is provided with the fixture, as shown on the standard-size fixture in Fig. 2. Any special adapter required to attach this stud to the particular testing machine being used, such as the standard Instron Type Df adapter shown in Fig. 1, can be provided as an option at nominal additional cost. The adapter is pinned to the stud and secured via the lock ring provided with the fixture."

A large number of fixtures have been provided to research groups around the world since that time and the test method is now in widespread use. ASTM Standard D 5379 governing the test method was first issued in 1993 (Reference 1). General testing procedures are provided in that standard. In addition, considerable additional discussion of results typically obtained is contained in the references listed here.",
                  "The standard test specimen (as shown installed in the front view photograph of Fig. 1) is 3\" long, 0.75\" wide, and of any thickness up to 0.50\". Typically, a specimen on the order of 0.1\" thick is used. The fixture will also accommodate shorter and narrower specimens, if desired.  A 90° notch is machined into each edge of the specimen, and a strain gage can be mounted on the specimen surface in the notched region to monitor shear strain. Either a standard ±45° biaxial gage or a special Iosipescu gage is commonly used. The small diameter rod projecting out of the fixture below the lower notch in the specimen (front view photograph in Fig. 1) is lifted up with a finger while installing a test specimen, to center the specimen left to right. The specimen is pushed up against the flat back of the fixture to locate it fore and aft. The tapered wedges are not intended to be clamps; they are adjusted with finger knobs to accommodate specimens of slightly varying widths. Wedges of alternate thickness can be provided to accommodate specimens outside this small range of thickness variation.",
                  "The moving half of the fixture incorporates a linear ball bushing (see rear view photograph in Fig. 1) that moves on a hardened steel vertical post mounted in the base of the fixture. This ball bearing eliminates guidepost binding and minimizes frictional resistance. The closeness of fit of the bearing can be adjusted via the screw and locking nut visible on the backside of the moving half of the fixture.",

A standard 1.25\" diameter stud with lock ring and 0.50\" diameter cross-pin hole, threaded into the moving half of the fixture, is provided with the fixture, as shown on the standard-size fixture in Fig. 2. Any special adapter required to attach this stud to the particular testing machine being used, such as the standard Instron Type Df adapter shown in Fig. 1, can be provided as an option at nominal additional cost. The adapter is pinned to the stud and secured via the lock ring provided with the fixture."
